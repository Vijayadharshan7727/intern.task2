Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning and data science community. It contains detailed information about passengers on board the Titanic, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not. This analysis focuses on cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, visualizing key features, and drawing meaningful insights about the passengers and their survival rates.

 Objectives of the Analysis
The main goals of this project are:

To understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
To handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
To visualize different features such as Age, Fare, Pclass, and Embarked.
To explore relationships between features and the survival of passengers.
To summarize key findings through statistical plots and observations.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis
numpy for numerical computations
matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for data visualization
plotly.express for interactive plotting (optional)
 Data Cleaning and Preparation
Upon loading the dataset, we begin with basic exploration using .head(), .info(), and .describe() functions. Missing values are then identified and handled:

Age: Filled with the mean age of the passengers.
Cabin: Filled with the string 'Unknown' to indicate missing cabin data.
Embarked: Filled with the most common port (mode()).
This step ensures the dataset is clean and ready for analysis without dropping potentially useful rows.

üìà Data Visualization
Several visualizations were created to better understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset:

Histogram of Age: Shows most passengers were between 20‚Äì40 years old.
Boxplot of Fare: Reveals significant outliers in fare values.
Survival Count Plot: Displays the number of survivors versus non-survivors.
Correlation Heatmap: Highlights how features like Fare and Pclass are correlated with survival.
Pairplot: Shows pairwise relationships between Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survived.
Boxplot of Age vs Survived: Demonstrates age differences between survivors and non-survivors.
Barplot of Pclass vs Survived: Indicates higher survival rates in first class.
Pie Chart of Embarked: Visualizes passenger distribution by embarkation port.
